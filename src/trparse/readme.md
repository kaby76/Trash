# trparse

## Summary

Parse a grammar or use generated parse to parse input

## Description

Parse files and output to stdout parse tree data.
The tool requires a pre-built parser via trgen for a grammar
for anything other than the standard parser grammars that
are supported. To specify the grammar, you can either
be in a trgen-generated parser directory, or use the -p option.

If using positional args on the command line, a file is parsed
depending on the extension of the file name:

* `.g2` for an ANTLRv2 grammar
* `.g3` for an ANTLRv3 grammar
* `.g4` for an ANTLRv4 grammar
* `.y` for a Bison grammar
* `.rex` for a Rex grammar
* `.gram` for a pegen grammar

You can force the type of parse with
the `--type` command-line option:

* `ANTLRv4` for ANTLRv2
* `ANTLRv3` for ANTLRv3
* `ANTLRv2` for ANTLRv4
* `Bison` for Bison
* `rex` for Rex
* `pegen_v3_10` for the `Generated/` parser

## Usage
    
    trparse (<string> | <options>)*
    -i, --input      Parse the given string as input.
    -t, --type       Specifies type of grammar: ANTLRv4, ANTLRv3, ANTLRv2, Bison, rex, pegen_v3_10
    -s, --start-rule Start rule name.
    -p, --parser     Location of pre-built parser (aka the trgen Generated/ directory)

## Examples

    trparse Java.g2
    trparse -i "1+2+3"
    trparse Foobar.g -t ANTLRv2
    echo "1+2+3" | trparse | trtree
    mkdir out; trparse MyParser.g4 MyLexer.g4 | trkleene | trsponge -o out
