# trunfoldlit

## Summary

Perform an unfold transform for all string literal lexer rules on a grammar

## Description

The unfoldlit command applies the unfold transform to a collection of terminal nodes
for string literal lexer rules in a grammar. An unfold operation substitutes
the right-hand side of a parser or lexer rule into a reference of the rule name that
occurs at the specified node. In this app, all lexer rules that have a string literal
on the right-hand side of the rule are identified as the symbols to unfold in parser
rules.

## Usage

    trunfoldlit

## Examples

Before:

	grammar Expression;
	s : ( e '*' e | INT ) ;
	e : e '*' e           # Mult
		| INT               # primary
		;
	INT : [0-9]+ ;
	WS : [ \t\n]+ -> skip ;

Command:

    trparse Expression.g4 | trunfoldlit | trsponge -c

After:

	grammar Expresion;
	s : e ;
	e : e '*' e       # Mult
	    | INT           # primary
	    ;
	INT : [0-9]+ ;
	WS : [ \t\n]+ -> skip ;

## Notes

If you are running MSYS2 on Windows, you may notice that XPaths are not being
processed by this command correctly. To avoid the Bash shell from altering
XPaths, type _export MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL="*"_, then execute your command.

## Current version
