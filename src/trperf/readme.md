# trperf

## Summary

Perform performance analysis of an Antlr grammar parse

## Description

Parse files and output to stdout parse tree data using
performance analysis turned on.
The tool requires a pre-built parser via trgen for a grammar
for anything other than the standard parser grammars that
are supported. To specify the grammar, you can either
be in a trgen-generated parser directory, or use the -p option.

## Usage
    
    trperf (<string> | <options>)*
    -c. -column      String of characters denoting columnns.
                     F = File name
                     d = Decision number
                     r = Rule name
                     i = Invocations
                     T = Time
                     k = Total k
                     m = Max k
                     f = Fallbacks
                     a = Ambiguities
                     e = Errors
                     t = Transitions
                     c = Input string at max-k
           Default is "FdriTkmfaetc".
    -i, --input      String to parse.
    -s, --start-rule Start rule name.
    -p, --parser     Location of pre-built parser (aka the trgen Generated/ directory)

## Examples

    # print out performance data for a parse, ignore the header line, sort on "Max k", and output in a formatted table.
    trperf aggregate01.sql | tail -n +2 | sort -k6 -n -r | column -t

## Current version

0.23.15 Updated trgen grammar dependency analysis.
